 * 
 * \mainpage A Skeleton Implementation of a "Full-Served" RTOS Model
 * This is an example of how to implement context-switching based on a 
 * full-served model. That is, the RTOS is implemented by an independent
 * "kernel" task, which has its own stack and calls the appropriate kernel 
 * function on behalf of the user task.
 *
 * \author Dr. Mantis Cheng
 * \date 29 September 2006
 *
 * ChangeLog: Modified by Alexander M. Hoole, October 2006.
 *			  -Rectified errors and enabled context switching.
 *			  -LED Testing code added for development (remove later).
 *
 * \section Implementation Note
 * This example uses the ATMEL AT90USB1287 instruction set as an example
 * for implementing the context switching mechanism. 
 * This code is ready to be loaded onto an AT90USBKey.  Once loaded the 
 * RTOS scheduling code will alternate lighting of the GREEN LED light on
 * LED D2 and D5 whenever the correspoing PING and PONG tasks are running.
 * (See the file "cswitch.S" for details.)

/**
  * This internal kernel function is the context switching mechanism.
  * It is done in a "funny" way in that it consists two halves: the top half
  * is called "Exit_Kernel()", and the bottom half is called "Enter_Kernel()".
  * When kernel calls this function, it starts the top half (i.e., exit). Right in
  * the middle, "Cp" is activated; as a result, Cp is running and the kernel is
  * suspended in the middle of this function. When Cp makes a system call,
  * it enters the kernel via the Enter_Kernel() software interrupt into
  * the middle of this function, where the kernel was suspended.
  * After executing the bottom half, the context of Cp is saved and the context
  * of the kernel is restore. Hence, when this function returns, kernel is active
  * again, but Cp is not running any more. 
  * (See file "switch.S" for details.)

/** 
  * This external function could be implemented in two ways:
  *  1) as an external function call, which is called by Kernel API call stubs;
  *  2) as an inline macro which maps the call into a "software interrupt";
  *       as for the AVR processor, we could use the external interrupt feature,
  *       i.e., INT0 pin.
  *  Note: Interrupts are assumed to be disabled upon calling Enter_Kernel().
  *     This is the case if it is implemented by software interrupt. However,
  *     as an external function call, it must be done explicitly. When Enter_Kernel()
  *     returns, then interrupts will be re-enabled by Enter_Kernel().
